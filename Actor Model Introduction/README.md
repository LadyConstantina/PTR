# PTR - Project 1: Starting with Actor Model in Elixir             

### *Student: GÃ®lca Constantina*                                       
                               
## Objectives                       
* Implement different actor behaviours            
* Implement Monitoring and Supervising actors 
* Apply Double Linked Lists and Semaphores on actors
           
## Testing

1. Clone the repository on you computer or download the content on your local device.
2. Enter the `..\Actor Model Introduction` directory and open the command line.
3. Type `iex`  *(If you have elixir installed, it should work. If not, consult an Elixir installation guide)*.
4. First thing, compile any file of type `.ex` with `c("file_name.ex")`.
5. To test the exercises, compile the respective files of type `.exs` with `c("file_name.exs")`. *(For testing the semaphore, you will need 2 separate command lines)*
