How to test?

Step 1: compile necessary files
c("worker.ex")
c("supervisor.ex")

Step 2: unlink the system from the shell supervisor
{:ok,pid} = MySupervisor.start_link(3)
Process.unlink(pid)

Step 3: see the children supervised by MySupervisor
Supervisor.which_children(pid)

Step 4: call :echo messages
GenServer.call(:worker1,{:echo,"Hello"})
GenServer.call(:worker2,{:echo," PTR!"})
GenServer.call(:worker3,{:echo,"I will die soon!"})

Step 5: call :kill message for worker3
GenServer.call(:worker3,{:kill})

Step 6: call :echo message for worker3. See that it works, he was respawned by the supervisor.
GenServer.call(:worker3,{:echo,"I was brought back to life!"})

Finish:
Supervisor.stop(pid)
