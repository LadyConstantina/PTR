## Objectives                       
* Implement common mathematical functions            
* Manipulate different types of data 
* Familiarise with the Elixir language and its syntax
           
## Testing

1. Clone the repository on you computer or download the content on your local device.
2. Enter the `..\Mathfunctions` directory and open the command line.
3. Type `iex`  *(If you have elixir installed, it should work. If not, consult an Elixir installation guide)*.
